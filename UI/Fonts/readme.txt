This is my biggest tipography project to date. My goal was to create a display font that combines traditional elements with elements of experimental typography. In my opinion, this font is a display font. Inspired by the VHS tapes and promotional materials of the 70s and 80s, the font contains postmodern elements and makes it really interesting to me.
